# Virtual Whiteboard

This is a blank digital space where multiple people can collaborate (write, share and interact) in real-time. Some of the common uses of a whiteboard are brainstorming, problem-solving and visualizing ideas.

## Features

- Browser synchronization
- Real-time collaboration
- Mobile support

### Tools Used

- Flask
- Python 
- Twilio Sync

## Notes

This is a work in progress. The project is at its early stages. I intend to add more features and improve the UI over time. Some of the ideas I am thinking to incorporate are:

- User authentication
- Synchornization of the clear button
- Reduce latency between users who type fast

## Reference

There are a couple of other whiteboard projects, with more features that I am currently looking into. Some of them are:
